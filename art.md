I like making art!

Lately I've been exploring art that bridges traditional mediums (pencil, paint, etc.) with newfangled digital technologies (Procreate, AI, etc.). Here are some things in this vein I've done recently:
* [Nonsense newspapers](https://mirandali707.github.io/nonsense_newspapers/index.html) was a project I did for CS230, Deep Learning, in which I trained a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce gibberish newspapers.
* [This post](#) details the progression of a piece I made with cardboard, gouache, pencil, white gel pen, a scanner, and Procreate.
* [Here's a post]({% post_url 2021-01-24-magdalene.md %}) about an experiment I did in which I animated a pencil sketch I'd done and used an open-source video frame interpolation library to multiply the framerate by 4.

I love magazines and print journalism, and have been making magazines (in close collaboration with a lot of lovely people who are too many to name) since high school.

From November 2018 to June 2019, I was Graphics Managing Editor at [The Stanford Daily](https://www.stanforddaily.com/). Here are the magazines I helped create:
* [Issue 4](https://issuu.com/stanforddailymagazine/docs/mag_4_issuu2)
* [Issue 5](https://issuu.com/stanforddailymagazine/docs/mag_5_issuu), a special edition on physical and mental health at Stanford
* [Issue 6](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uuyYQ8CWSB_WdbEP0ALFJ46pzHeepPBX/view?usp=sharing), a special edition for LGBTQ+ pride

In my senior year of high school, I was the Print Managing Editor for my high school newspaper, [The Talon](https://lahstalon.org/). Here are the magazines I helped create then:
* [The senior magazine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cNfl1VgtFMEnKyFt0rpKl2SaSUAwUlK3/view?usp=sharing), distributed at graduation (two of the hands on this cover belong to me!)
* [The news magazine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12c71byTYqfxMA3CNqs9-FvGHuUVOmhvN/view?usp=sharing), our once-yearly magazine
