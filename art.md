I like making art!

I love magazines and print journalism, and have been making magazines (in close collaboration with a lot of lovely people who are too many to name) since high school.

From November 2018 to June 2019, I was Graphics Managing Editor at [The Stanford Daily](https://www.stanforddaily.com/). Here are the magazines I helped create:
* [Issue 4](https://issuu.com/stanforddailymagazine/docs/mag_4_issuu2)
* [Issue 5](https://issuu.com/stanforddailymagazine/docs/mag_5_issuu), a special edition on physical and mental health at Stanford
* [Issue 6](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uuyYQ8CWSB_WdbEP0ALFJ46pzHeepPBX/view?usp=sharing), a special edition for LGBTQ+ pride

In my senior year of high school, I was the Print Managing Editor for my high school newspaper, [The Talon](https://lahstalon.org/). Here are the magazines I helped create then:
* [The senior magazine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cNfl1VgtFMEnKyFt0rpKl2SaSUAwUlK3/view?usp=sharing), distributed at graduation (two of the hands on this cover belong to me!)
* [The news magazine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12c71byTYqfxMA3CNqs9-FvGHuUVOmhvN/view?usp=sharing), our once-yearly magazine
