![a tastefully blurry picture of Miranda, who has long black hair and a face and is laughing cheekily](/img/miranda.jpg)

Hello, my name is Miranda; I'm a rising junior at Stanford majoring in CS with a focus on Biocomputation. My interests include leveraging the potential of computation and AI/ML to improve health outcomes here and far away, supporting journalists in their pursuit of the truth, making things (art, code, data, words, etc.) beautiful through thoughtful and intentional design, and learning through teaching. I hope you're having a good day :^)

In recent past, I've:
* [trained a GAN to generate gibberish newspapers in the name of art](https://mirandali707.github.io/nonsense_newspapers/), made a [digital zine](https://mirandali707.github.io/nonsense_newspapers/zine.html), and printed 20 physical zines (here's the [proof](https://issuu.com/mirandali707/docs/newspaper_zine_draft1); please forgive the bleed marks -- for embarrassing reasons I am no longer able to access my file to export a .pdf without them)
* taught and done accessibility-related work for the introductory CS courses at Stanford, CS106A and CS106B, including writing alternative homework problems for visually impaired students

Currently, I'm:
* working with [Teus Media](https://www.teus.media/) to build a voice conversion pipeline to anonymize the voices of at-risk subjects in upcoming documentary films
* helping organize the second round of [Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/), in which kind-hearted volunteers from all over the world teach enthusiastic students from all over the world how to code in Python
* taking as many aimless walks through residential neighborhoods as my legs will allow
* tending to a small army of houseplants
